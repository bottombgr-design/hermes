"""Write-approval gate + pending store for memory and skill writes.

Background
----------
The agent writes to two persistent stores that survive across sessions:

  * **memory** — MEMORY.md / USER.md, small (~200 char) declarative entries
  * **skills** — SKILL.md + supporting files, potentially huge (10-100 KB)

Both stores are written from two origins:

  * **foreground** — a normal agent turn (user is present / chatting)
  * **background_review** — the self-improvement review fork that runs after a
    turn and autonomously decides what to save (the source of the
    "wrong assumptions" users complained about)

This module lets the user gate those writes per-subsystem with a boolean
``write_approval``:

  * ``false`` (default) — write freely (the pre-gate behaviour)
  * ``true``            — require approval: do not commit the write; either
    prompt inline (memory, interactive CLI only) or **stage** it to a pending
    store and surface it for the user to approve or reject out-of-band

The size asymmetry between memory and skills is real and unavoidable: a memory
entry can be reviewed inline in a chat bubble; a 100 KB SKILL.md cannot. So
the gate stages BOTH to disk, but review affordances differ by subsystem
(see ``hermes_cli`` slash handlers): memory shows full content, skills show
metadata + a one-line gist + a ``diff`` escape hatch (CLI/dashboard/file).

Staging is mandatory for background-origin writes (a daemon thread cannot
block on an interactive prompt) and for gateway sessions (no inline prompt
channel — review happens via ``/memory pending``). Foreground CLI memory
writes prompt inline via the dangerous-command approval callback; skill
writes always stage (too big to eyeball mid-loop).

Pending records live under ``<HERMES_HOME>/pending/{memory,skills}/<id>.json``
so they survive process restarts and can be reviewed from CLI, gateway, or the
web dashboard.
