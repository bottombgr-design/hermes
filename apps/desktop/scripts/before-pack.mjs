/**
 * before-pack.mjs — electron-builder beforePack hook.
 *
 * Two responsibilities:
 *
 * 1. Moves any stale unpacked app directory (`appOutDir`) aside into a nested
 *    backup under `release/.rebuild-backup/<dirname>` before electron-builder
 *    stages the Electron binaries into it. The backup is cleaned up by
 *    after-pack.mjs on success, and restored by the CLI build wrapper on failure.
 *
 * WHY RENAME INSTEAD OF DELETE
 * ----------------------------
 * Previously this hook `fs.rmSync`'d the directory (see git history). That
 * left zero recovery path when the build after the cleanup failed — git merge
 * conflict, npm error, OOM, Ctrl-C, etc. The user's running Hermes.exe was
 * already shut down (electron-builder needs the file unlocked), the unpacked
 * tree was gone, and the new one never materialised. Result: Hermes.exe
 * vanished until a successful rebuild.
 *
 * Renaming preserves the last-known-good build so:
 *  - `hermes_cli/main.py` can restore the backup automatically on build
 *    failure — the desktop shortcut keeps working without user intervention.
 *  - `after-pack.mjs` removes the backup only after the new build completes.
 *
 * WHY NESTED UNDER `.rebuild-backup/`
 * -----------------------------------
 * Sibling renames (e.g. `win-unpacked.bak`) risk being matched by:
 *  - `_purge_electron_build_cache`'s `release/*-unpacked` glob
 *  - `_desktop_packaged_executable`'s macOS `mac*` glob, which would treat
 *    `mac-arm64.bak/Hermes.app/...` as a candidate executable and skip the
 *    corrupt-download retry that `_cmd_desktop` needs to perform.
 *
 * Nesting under `release/.rebuild-backup/` (a dot-directory) avoids both
 * globs: the `*-unpacked` glob won't enter the dot-directory, and the `mac*`
 * glob won't match a path starting with `.rebuild-backup`.
 *
 * Cross-platform: rename(2) on the same filesystem is atomic on Linux/macOS
 * and near-atomic on NTFS. All platforms benefit; this path runs for every
 * `beforePack` regardless of `electronPlatformName`.
 *
 * Best-effort: if rename fails (cross-device mount, permissions, EBUSY) we
 * fall back to the old `rmSync` so the build can still proceed — but we log
 * a warning so the user knows they have no backup.
 *
 * 2. Re-stages node-pty's native files for the ACTUAL target platform/arch
 *    of this pack. `npm run build` already staged node-pty once for the
 *    host machine (see scripts/stage-native-deps.mjs), which is correct for
 *    single-arch builds matching the host. But electron-builder can target
 *    a different arch than the host (cross-build), or pack multiple archs
 *    from one `npm run build` (e.g. `dist:mac` => x64 + arm64). Only this
 *    hook knows the real per-target arch, via `context.arch` /
 *    `context.electronPlatformName` — so it re-stages on top of whatever
 *    `npm run build` left behind, per target, right before files are read
 *    for packing.
 *
 * electron-builder passes a context with:
 *   - appOutDir:            the unpacked app directory about to be staged
 *   - electronPlatformName: 'win32' | 'darwin' | 'linux'
 *   - arch:                 Arch enum (0=ia32, 1=x64, 2=armv7l, 3=arm64, 4=universal)
