Home Assistant platform adapter.

Connects to the HA WebSocket API for real-time event monitoring.
State-change events are converted to MessageEvent objects and forwarded
to the agent for processing.  Outbound messages are delivered as HA
persistent notifications.

Requires:
- aiohttp (already in messaging extras)
- HASS_TOKEN env var (Long-Lived Access Token)
- HASS_URL env var (default: http://homeassistant.local:8123)

    close to finish.

    Replaces the previous ``asyncio.wait_for(closeable.close(),
    timeout=...)`` (#67470 review, egilewski): ``wait_for``'s timeout path
    cancels the awaited coroutine and then WAITS for that cancellation to
    actually complete -- so a ``close()`` that catches/suppresses
    ``CancelledError`` and keeps running its own cleanup left ``wait_for``
    (and everything downstream of it) pending indefinitely (probe:
    ``_DRAIN_TIMEOUT=0.05``, still pending after 0.20s -- confirmed by Sol
    xhigh's exhaustive mechanism review, #67470).

    The fix creates the close as its OWN task before any await (so no
    cancellation can land before the task exists), retains it durably
    (``_retain``), and observes it with ``asyncio.wait(timeout=...)``
    instead. ``asyncio.wait`` just watches with a deadline -- on timeout it
    returns without touching the task, so on deadline we simply return: the
    close keeps running, detached, retained so it isn't garbage collected
    mid-flight (rather than cancelled, which could destroy its only
    remaining chance to finish). A cancellation landing on the CALLER of
    this function propagates normally out of the ``asyncio.wait`` above,
    but likewise never reaches the inner close task -- ``asyncio.wait``
    does not cancel its members on the waiter's own cancellation, which is
    exactly the "abandon, don't wait" behavior this mechanism needs.

    IRREDUCIBLE RESIDUAL: this bounds the CALLER's progress, not physical
    closure -- it does NOT prove the resource was ever actually released.
    That is true even for a single, ordinary ``close()`` failure (an
    exception, a ``TimeoutError``, a self-raised ``CancelledError``): only
    one close attempt is ever made per call site, so any failure on that
    one attempt already means physical closure is unproven, not just the
    hangs-or-raises-forever case (Sol xhigh mechanism re-review, #67470).
    No generic wrapper can distinguish "close() failed but the resource is
    actually fine" from "close() failed and it's still open" -- best-effort
    abandonment/swallowing is the correct behavior here, not a workaround.
    Two more properties of the SAME residual, not new gaps: (1) an
    event-loop shutdown that force-cancels every remaining task
    (``asyncio.run()``'s own teardown) can still block on a
    cancellation-resistant orphan, or skip creating a later close's task
    entirely if it cancels an outer ``_close_both()``/``_full_teardown()``
    sequence before that later close is even reached -- both are
    properties of the runner's shutdown, not of this adapter, and no
    per-close mechanism here can change them; (2) this function cannot
    tell a close-originated ``CancelledError`` (see ``_close_quietly``)
    apart from one delivered by an external shutdown cancelling this exact
    task, so its log message is a best guess, not a certainty.
