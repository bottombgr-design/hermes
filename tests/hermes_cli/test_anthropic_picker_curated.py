"""Regression tests for the Anthropic model-picker dropping curated aliases.

Bug — newly-routed curated aliases vanished on a native Anthropic setup
    ``provider_model_ids("anthropic")`` returned the live ``/v1/models`` dump
    verbatim whenever Anthropic credentials were configured. Anthropic's API
    lags behind freshly-routed aliases (e.g. ``claude-fable-5``, which is
    reachable on Anthropic before the models endpoint enumerates it), so the
    curated entry disappeared from the picker. The picker now merges the
    curated ``_PROVIDER_MODELS["anthropic"]`` list with the live catalog —
    curated entries first, live-only models appended, deduped — mirroring the
    OpenAI curated-merge philosophy.
