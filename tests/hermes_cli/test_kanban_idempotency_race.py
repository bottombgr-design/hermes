"""Concurrency regression: ``create_task`` idempotency-key race-safety.

``idx_tasks_idempotency`` used to be a plain (non-UNIQUE) index, so two
connections that both SELECT-miss on the same key could each INSERT, leaving
two active task rows for one idempotency key. The UNIQUE partial index over
active (non-archived) rows plus IntegrityError recovery in ``create_task``
make the losing writer return the winner's id instead of inserting a duplicate.
