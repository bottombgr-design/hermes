"""Regression tests for #28712 — kanban dispatcher must not auto-promote
worker-initiated ``kanban_block`` (sticky blocks), but must keep
auto-recovering circuit-breaker blocks.

The bug: when a worker called ``kanban_block(reason="review-required:
...")`` to hand off to a human, the dispatcher's ``recompute_ready``
would promote the task back to ``ready`` on the next tick.  The fresh
worker found nothing to do (work already applied), exited cleanly, and
got recorded as a ``protocol_violation`` → ``gave_up`` → promote → loop
until manual intervention.

These tests pin down:

* Worker / operator-initiated blocks are sticky and survive
  ``recompute_ready``.
* Out-of-process bridge blocks obey the same sticky lifecycle.
* Circuit-breaker blocks (``gave_up`` event, status flipped via
  ``_record_task_failure``) still auto-recover — the original intent
  of #40c1decb3 is preserved.
* An explicit ``kanban_unblock`` clears the sticky state.
* The full block → promote → crash → ``gave_up`` loop is broken after
  this fix: subsequent ticks leave the task blocked.

The tangentially related schema-init ordering bug originally reported
in #28712 (``init_db`` crashing on legacy DBs that pre-dated the
``session_id`` migration) is covered separately by
``test_kanban_db.py::test_connect_migrates_legacy_db_before_optional_column_indexes``,
landed via #28754 / #28781 ahead of this fix.
