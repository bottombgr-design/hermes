"""Regression tests for the verified-blocker rule (Article XII P5 + XIV P2).

The 2026-07-19 incident: an audit declared a task ``Blocked on SSH key`` —
the SSH key was available throughout (``~/.ssh/id_ed25519_macbook_pro`` was
loadable via ``ssh-agent``); the agent did not attempt to load it. The
false blocker went undetected for 8 days, leaving a misclaim in production
that surfaced only after independent verification.

The structural fix: ``block_task()`` now requires a falsification record
(``evidence``) for non-dependency blocks when ``kanban.require_block_evidence``
is enabled in ``config.yaml``. The runtime gate makes the failure mode
impossible by construction — an agent cannot transition a task to
``blocked`` without first recording the verification it performed.

These tests pin the gate:

* Non-dependency block without evidence → ``ValueError``.
* Non-dependency block with evidence → succeeds; evidence recorded in the
  ``blocked`` event payload + synthesized run summary.
* Dependency block without evidence → succeeds (no external state claim;
  routing decision, not a falsifiable hypothesis).
* Circuit-breaker (system-generated) blocker still works — the breaker
  records ``last_failure_error`` as its own evidence, and a non-empty
  ``summary`` is plumbed through to the ``gave_up`` event. The
  ``_record_task_failure`` path is NOT subject to the evidence gate; the
  failure is system-observed, not agent-claimed.
* Default off (legacy call sites without evidence still work) — the
  config flag is opt-in so existing code and tests are not broken.
