"""Regression tests for the ephemeral-context *glue target* selection.

Context: ``current_turn_user_idx`` is snapshotted once at turn-start
(``agent/turn_context.py``), right after the user message is appended. Before
the glue site in ``agent/conversation_loop.py`` injects ephemeral plugin/memory
context onto the current turn's user message, ``messages`` can be mutated by:

* preflight context compression — which does **not** keep the same list *or*
  the same dict objects: it ``.copy()``s the protected tail into fresh dicts
  (``context_compressor.compress`` / ``_fresh_compaction_message_copy``), so a
  turn-start index goes stale *and* object identity is lost; and
* ``repair_message_sequence_with_cursor`` — in-place alternation repair that
  reorders/relocates messages.

An earlier fix recomputed the *globally-last* user message at glue time. That
over-corrects: the loop appends synthetic continuation/recovery user nudges
(length-continue, codex-ack, verify-stop) which become the last user message,
so glue would drift off the real request and onto a "[System: continue]"
nudge (hermes-sweeper review on #63348).

The current fix stamps the current turn's user message with a per-turn marker
(``TURN_USER_MARKER_KEY``) that rides the compaction ``.copy()`` through and is
absent on the synthetic nudges. ``select_turn_glue_idx`` re-identifies that
exact message at its post-mutation position — never the global last user.

These tests cover both the pure selector and a faithful mirror of the
``conversation_loop`` request-assembly glue (same pattern as
``tests/run_agent/test_steer.py``, whose helper tests mirror the run_conversation
injection): relocated-after-compaction, a following synthetic nudge, and the
compacted-away drop.
