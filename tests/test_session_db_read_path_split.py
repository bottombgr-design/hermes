"""Tests for the SessionDB read-path split (per-thread read-only connections).

The gateway shares ONE SessionDB across every agent, so recall/browse reads
used to queue behind writer flushes on self._lock — a measured production
convoy (a 0.2s FTS query stretched to 112s while 6-8 concurrent turns
flushed tool results). These tests pin the new contract: reads run on a
per-thread read-only connection under WAL, never touch self._lock, and fall
back to the legacy locked path when WAL or the read connection is missing.
