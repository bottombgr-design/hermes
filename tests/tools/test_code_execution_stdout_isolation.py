"""Regression: concurrent execute_code tool dispatch must not poison sys.stdout.

``code_execution_tool``'s sandbox RPC handler runs on a per-connection socket
thread, so several ``execute_code`` calls can be in flight simultaneously (e.g.
a parallel ``delegate_task`` batch, where every subagent uses execute_code).

The old implementation silenced internal tool handlers with a raw
process-global assignment::

    _real_stdout, _real_stderr = sys.stdout, sys.stderr
    devnull = open(os.devnull, "w")
    try:
        sys.stdout = devnull
        sys.stderr = devnull
        result = handle_function_call(...)
    finally:
        sys.stdout, sys.stderr = _real_stdout, _real_stderr
        devnull.close()

``sys.stdout`` is process-global. With two threads interleaving, thread B
captures thread A's devnull as its ``_real_stdout``, A closes that handle, and
B then "restores" the CLOSED handle. Every subsequent bare ``print`` anywhere
in the process raises::

    ValueError: I/O operation on closed file.

Observed 2026-07-28 on a live gateway: 328 occurrences beginning the instant a
3-way parallel delegation launched; all three subagents died. The tracebacks
landed on an innocent ``print`` in agent/conversation_loop.py, nowhere near the
actual culprit.
