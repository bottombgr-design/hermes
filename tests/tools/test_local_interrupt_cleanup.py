"""Regression tests for _wait_for_process subprocess cleanup on exception exit.

When the poll loop exits via KeyboardInterrupt or SystemExit (SIGTERM via
cli.py signal handler, SIGINT on the main thread in non-interactive -q mode,
or explicit sys.exit from some caller), the child subprocess must be killed
before the exception propagates — otherwise the local backend's use of
os.setsid leaves an orphan with PPID=1.

The live repro that motivated this: hermes chat -q ... 'sleep 300', SIGTERM
to the python process, sleep 300 survived with PPID=1 for the full 300 s
because _wait_for_process never got to call _kill_process before python
died.  See commit message for full context.

    regardless of host load — those waits are wall-clock deadlines, not
    work-bound (see LocalEnvironment._kill_process). On quiet hosts this
    returns in <1s.

    The timeout is deliberately SMALL. This helper is one of three sequential
    waits in test_wait_for_process_kills_subprocess_on_keyboardinterrupt; their
    sum must stay well under the 30s global pytest-timeout. That cap uses the
    ``thread`` method (pyproject.toml addopts), which on expiry hard-``os._exit``s
    the per-file interpreter — crashing the ENTIRE file ("1 file where no tests
    ran") instead of failing one assertion. A generous timeout here is exactly
    what used to trip that cap under xdist load and spuriously fail unrelated
    PRs. If the group genuinely hasn't died within this budget, the caller
    fails one assertion cleanly, with a process-table snapshot.
