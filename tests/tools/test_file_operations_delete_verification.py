"""Regression tests for the V4A delete verification gap.

Issue #57788's fix (#57789) added post-write verification for `write_file`
and `patch_replace`. The issue explicitly noted V4A delete was out of scope:

> V4A **delete** operations are not covered by this fix (delete success is
> "file no longer exists," a different semantic than "content matches" —
> verifying that correctly needs its own check, and was out of scope for
> this fix to keep it minimal and low-risk).

`ShellFileOperations.delete_file` and `delete_path` call `_python_delete`,
which runs a Python snippet via the executor and trusts the exit code. If
the executor returns `exit_code == 0` but the file is still on disk (race
condition, backend FS oddity, sandbox quirk), the tool reports success for
a non-existent delete — the user thinks the file is gone but it isn't.

This test suite verifies that delete operations correctly report failure
when the underlying executor reports success but the file is still on
disk. The fix should re-check that the path doesn't exist after the
executor returns 0.
