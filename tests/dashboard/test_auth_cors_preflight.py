"""Regression tests for CORS-preflight handling in the dashboard auth gate.

Issue #59052: ``CORSMiddleware`` is registered first, so it ends up
*innermost* and runs after ``auth_middleware``. A browser CORS preflight
(``OPTIONS``) carries no session token, so the token check returned 401
before ``CORSMiddleware`` could answer with the preflight headers, and the
SPA's cross-origin requests to protected ``/api/`` routes failed.

The contract these tests pin down:

  * A genuine preflight (``OPTIONS`` + ``Access-Control-Request-Method``)
    to a protected route short-circuits the token check and is answered by
    ``CORSMiddleware`` with the CORS headers (not 401).
  * A non-``OPTIONS`` request to a protected route without a token still
    returns 401 (the auth gate is otherwise unchanged).
  * A bare ``OPTIONS`` with no preflight header does NOT bypass auth — it
    falls through to the normal gate, so it cannot be used to probe
    protected routes without credentials.
