"""/reset (/new), /branch, /resume, /sessions, /title, /topic, /rollback, /undo, /retry slash-command handlers for GatewayRunner.

Moved verbatim from ``gateway/slash_commands.py`` (god-file decomposition,
Phase N+1). Bodies are byte-identical to their pre-extraction form; ``self``
is still the ``GatewayRunner``, so every ``self.<attr>`` still resolves
through the MRO exactly as before.

Module-level ``gateway.run`` helpers a handler needs are still imported
lazily inside the handler body — the same deferred-import discipline the
single-file form used, which is what keeps the graph acyclic.
