"""Collect every MEDIA:/[[audio_as_voice]] tag emitted across one agent turn.

The gateway streams an agent turn as several assistant segments split by
tool calls. Post-stream media delivery historically scanned only the final
response segment, so when a turn emitted more than one audio clip (for
example, an answer reveal voiced just before the next question), only the
last clip was delivered and the earlier ones were silently dropped.

``collect_turn_media_text`` joins the content of every assistant segment in
the turn so all clips are delivered, falling back to the final response when
no assistant segments are available.

    Callers pass this turn's messages (``agent_messages`` sliced from

    replay guarantee on its own: after split or in-place compaction the
    gateway deliberately reports ``history_offset=0``, so the slice can still
    contain retained prior-turn segments. Delivery is what prevents replay,
    by excluding paths already present in the history media set.
