# Writing Plans

## Overview

Write comprehensive implementation plans assuming the engineer has zero context for our codebase and questionable taste. Document everything they need to know: which files to touch for each task, code, testing, docs they might need to check, how to test it. Give them the whole plan as bite-sized tasks. DRY. YAGNI. TDD. Frequent commits.

Assume they are a skilled developer, but know almost nothing about our toolset or problem domain. Assume they don't know good test design very well.

**Save plans to:** `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`

## Scope Check

If the spec covers multiple independent subsystems, it should have been broken into sub-project specs during brainstorming. If it wasn't, suggest breaking this into separate plans — one per subsystem. Each plan should produce working, testable software on its own.

## File Structure

Before defining tasks, map out which files will be created or modified and what each one is responsible for. This is where decomposition decisions get locked in.

- Design units with clear boundaries and well-defined interfaces. Each file should have one clear responsibility.
- Prefer smaller, focused files over large ones that do too much.
- Files that change together should live together. Split by responsibility, not by technical layer.
- In existing codebases, follow established patterns.

## Task Right-Sizing

A task is the smallest unit that carries its own test cycle and is worth a fresh reviewer's gate. When drawing task boundaries: fold setup, configuration, scaffolding, and documentation steps into the task whose deliverable needs them; split only where a reviewer could meaningfully reject one task while approving its neighbor. Each task ends with an independently testable deliverable.

## Bite-Sized Task Granularity

**Each step is one action (2-5 minutes):**

- "Write the failing test" - step
- "Run it to make sure it fails" - step
- "Implement the minimal code to make the test pass" - step
- "Run the tests and make sure they pass" - step
- "Commit" - step

## Plan Document Header

**Every plan MUST start with this header:**

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan

**Goal:** [One sentence describing what this builds]

**Architecture:** [2-3 sentences about approach]

**Tech Stack:** [Key technologies/libraries]

## Global Constraints

[The spec's project-wide requirements — version floors, dependency limits,
naming and copy rules, platform requirements — one line each, with exact
values copied verbatim from the spec. Every task's requirements implicitly
include this section.]
```

## Task Structure

````markdown
### Task N: [Component Name]

**Files:**

- Create: `exact/path/to/file.py`
- Modify: `exact/path/to/existing.py:123-145`
- Test: `tests/exact/path/to/test.py`

**Interfaces:**

- Consumes: [what this task uses from earlier tasks — exact signatures]
- Produces: [what later tasks rely on — exact function names, parameter and return types]

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```python
def test_specific_behavior():
    result = function(input)
    assert result == expected
```
````

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**
      Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
      Expected: FAIL

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

```python
def function(input):
    return expected
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**
      Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
      Expected: PASS

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/path/test.py src/path/file.py
git commit -m "feat: add specific feature"
```

```

## No Placeholders

Every step must contain the actual content an engineer needs. These are **plan failures** — never write them:
- "TBD", "TODO", "implement later", "fill in details"
- "Add appropriate error handling" / "add validation" / "handle edge cases"
- "Write tests for the above" (without actual test code)
- "Similar to Task N" (repeat the code — the engineer may be reading tasks out of order)
- Steps that describe what to do without showing how (code blocks required for code steps)
- References to types, functions, or methods not defined in any task

## Self-Review

After writing the complete plan, check:

1. **Spec coverage:** Skim each section/requirement in the spec. Can you point to a task that implements it? List any gaps.
2. **Placeholder scan:** Search your plan for red flags — any of the patterns from the "No Placeholders" section above. Fix them.
3. **Type consistency:** Do the types, method signatures, and property names you used in later tasks match what you defined in earlier tasks?

If you find issues, fix them inline.

## Execution Handoff

After saving the plan, offer execution choice:

**"Plan complete and saved to `docs/plans/<filename>.md`. Two execution options:**

**1. Delegated (recommended)** — I dispatch a fresh subagent per task via `delegate_task`, review between tasks, fast iteration

**2. Inline Execution** — Execute tasks in this session using executing-plans, batch execution with checkpoints

**Which approach?"**

## Hermes Integration

- Use `write_file` to save the plan to `docs/plans/`
- Use `read_file` to read specs and existing code
- Use `search_files` to find patterns across the codebase
- Use `terminal` for git commands
- Use `delegate_task` for subagent-driven execution
- For Hermes Agent development, always use `scripts/run_tests.sh` (never raw `pytest`)
```
