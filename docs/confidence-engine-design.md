# Confidence Scoring Engine — Full Design

> Background document for the generic engine submitted in this PR.

## Problem

Memory in long-running AI agents grows without bound. Entries accumulate — some are transient troubleshooting notes, others are permanent user preferences — but they're all treated equally. When the memory cap is hit, the agent evicts blindly, often sacrificing high-value recent information while keeping stale transient data.

At 134 entries across 10 days of use, this problem became concrete. The agent started dropping freshly written preferences to make room for months-old completed-task records.

## Solution: Four-Dimensional Scoring

The core formula is `score = source_weight × recency_decay + Σ(bonus_keywords × clamped_weight)`, bounded [0, 1].

### Dimension 1 — Source Trust

| Source | Weight | Rationale |
|:--|:--:|:--|
| User-stated | 1.0 | User explicitly said this. Permanent TTL candidate. |
| LLM-inferred | 0.4 | Agent extracted from context. Subject to hallucination. Lower starting score. |

### Dimension 2 — Recency Decay

| Age | Decay | Rationale |
|:--|:--:|:--|
| 0–30 days | 1.0 | Current |
| 30–90 days | 0.8 | Recent |
| 90–180 days | 0.6 | Aging |
| 180–365 days | 0.4 | Stale |
| >365 days | 0.2 | Archive territory |

**Decay bypass**: Entries matching a CONSTANT_SAFELIST (birthdays, allergies, permanent rules) skip decay entirely. Separately, `fact_type_constant` entries — those without transient language markers — also bypass decay.

### Dimension 3 — Fact Type Classification

Based on arxiv 2604.11364's three-tier fact classification:

| Type | Detection | Decay behavior |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Constant** | No transient markers + source=user_stated + length>20, OR safelist match | Decay bypassed |
| **Mutable** | All other entries | Normal decay |
| **Transient** | Keywords: "temporary," "one-time," "this time" | Accelerated decay (×0.5) |

### Dimension 4 — Bonus Keywords

Content patterns detected via regex that add or subtract from the base score:

| Bonus | Weight | Example pattern |
|:--|:--:|:--|
| Permanence marker | +0.3 | "permanent", "always", "lifetime" |
| Lesson learned | +0.2 | "lesson", "methodology", "rule", "principle" |
| Personal preference | +0.2 | "prefers", "habit", "usually" |
| Work decision | +0.1 | "decided", "chose", "designed" |
| Completed task | -0.2 | "completed", "deployed", "fixed" |
| One-time info | -0.3 | "temporary", "one-time", "this time" |

All bonuses clamped to [-0.3, 0.3].

### Threshold Mapping

| Score | Level | TTL | Action |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| ≥0.80 | Permanent | Never expire | Keep |
| ≥0.50 | Long-term | 365 days | Keep |
| ≥0.30 | Medium-term | 180 days | Keep |
| ≥0.10 | Short-term | 90 days | Review |
| <0.10 | Volatile | 30 days | Evict |

## Production Validation

The full engine (with project-specific safelist, language-specific regex patterns, and source classification from a separate Phase 5b pipeline) has been scoring 134 memory entries in early testing. Key observations:

- **No false evictions observed in initial testing**: No user-stated critical facts have been flagged for eviction
- **3:1 signal ratio**: ~75% of entries fall into long-term/permanent tiers, ~25% into review/evict tiers — manageable churn
- **Batch performance**: `assess_batch(134)` completes in <50ms on consumer hardware

## What's Omitted from the Generic Version

| Omitted | Reason |
|:--|:--|
| CONSTANT_SAFELIST patterns | Project-specific (personal health, family, hostnames) |
| Chinese regex bonus keywords | Language-specific |
| Source classification pipeline | Depends on a separate Phase 5b metadata system |
| Tuned decay thresholds | Calibrated per-project usage patterns |

These are documented here for context but excluded from the generic PR to keep it minimally viable and project-agnostic.
