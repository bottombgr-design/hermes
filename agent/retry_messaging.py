"""Helpers for retry-path messaging and backoff selection.

Extracted from the monolithic ``run_conversation`` body in
``conversation_loop.py`` so that the backoff-parameter selection, the
terminal error-message construction, and the terminal return-dict shape
are independently testable without spinning up a full ``AIAgent``.

These functions encode the *production* decision logic — the conversation
loop calls them, and tests import them directly.
