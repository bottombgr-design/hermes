"""Per-agent iteration budget — thread-safe consume/refund counter.

Extracted from ``run_agent.py``.  Each ``AIAgent`` instance (parent or
subagent) holds an :class:`IterationBudget`; the parent's cap comes from
``max_iterations`` (default 500), each subagent's cap comes from
``delegation.max_iterations`` (default 50).

``run_agent`` re-exports ``IterationBudget`` so existing
``from run_agent import IterationBudget`` imports keep working unchanged.

    """Thread-safe iteration counter for an agent.

    Each agent (parent or subagent) gets its own ``IterationBudget``.
    The parent's budget is capped at ``max_iterations`` (default 500).
    Each subagent gets an independent budget capped at
    ``delegation.max_iterations`` (default 50) — this means total
    iterations across parent + subagents can exceed the parent's cap.
    Users control the per-subagent limit via ``delegation.max_iterations``
    in config.yaml.

    ``execute_code`` (programmatic tool calling) iterations are refunded via
    :meth:`refund` so they don't eat into the budget.  Refunds are capped
    at ``max_refunds`` (default 15) per turn to prevent infinite loops when
    the model repeatedly calls execute_code without making progress.
