"""Session adapter for codex app-server runtime.

Owns one Codex thread per Hermes session. Drives `turn/start`, consumes
streaming notifications via CodexEventProjector, handles server-initiated
approval requests (apply_patch, exec command), translates cancellation,
and returns a clean turn result that AIAgent.run_conversation() can splice
into its `messages` list.

Lifecycle:
    session = CodexAppServerSession(cwd="/home/x/proj")
    session.ensure_started()                              # spawns + handshake + thread/start
    result = session.run_turn(user_input="hello")         # blocks until turn/completed
    # result.final_text          → assistant text returned to caller
    # result.projected_messages  → list of {role, content, ...} for messages list
    # result.tool_iterations     → how many tool-shaped items completed (skill nudge counter)
    # result.interrupted         → True if Ctrl+C / interrupt_requested fired mid-turn
    session.close()                                       # tears down subprocess

Threading model: the adapter is single-threaded from the caller's perspective.
The underlying CodexAppServerClient owns its own reader threads but exposes
blocking-with-timeout queues that this adapter polls in a loop, so the run_turn
call is synchronous and behaves like AIAgent's existing chat_completions loop.

    stalls in one evening.

    chars ACROSS the whole turn and once the budget is spent, every further
    tool-role message this turn (regardless of its own per-result size) is
    truncated or fully suppressed. Mutates ``messages`` (a

    assistant tool_call message (name + args, no result body) is left
    alone since it's small and needed for alternation.

# Hermes's own LOCAL PROJECTION of tool-output content: it mutates
# ``messages`` (the projector's output) AFTER Codex's app-server subprocess
# has already run the tool, fed the full result to the model as part of its
# own turn context, and moved on. It never touches what Codex actually sent
# upstream, so it cannot cap the real window.
#
# Separately, turn_context.py's preflight headroom backstop
# (_MIN_ABSOLUTE_HEADROOM_TOKENS) only runs BETWEEN turns, using the
# previous turn's final usage. But thread/tokenUsage/updated notifications
# (consumed by _apply_token_usage_notification, called from inside this
# very while-loop below) arrive continuously DURING a turn — confirmed live
# in agent.log via repeated "HC80042-DEBUG usage-applied" lines firing
# several times between one "conversation turn:" marker and the next.
# Nothing consumed that live data mid-turn. Because terminal/file-ops/MCP
# calls run INSIDE the codex subprocess's own agentic loop (see the
# "Runtime: codex app-server" banner), a single Hermes-level turn can chain
# many internal Codex tool calls — and therefore many real prompt-token
# jumps — before ever yielding back to Hermes. A start-of-turn check can
# only ever see the *previous* turn's final tally; it structurally cannot
# stop a turn that overruns from the inside. Six of the seven stalls
# tonight were gradual (~10-30K tokens/turn) and the preflight backstop
# caught every one cleanly; the seventh was one outsized turn that blew
# past the window before it ever yielded.
#
# Fix: enforce the SAME absolute-headroom invariant the preflight backstop
# uses, but continuously, using the live usage snapshot we already receive
# mid-turn. The instant remaining headroom drops below the floor, interrupt
# the turn immediately instead of letting Codex's internal loop keep
# running — the turn's last real usage still feeds the normal
# preflight/compaction path (via codex_runtime._record_codex_app_server_usage
# -> context_compressor.update_from_response) on the very next turn.
