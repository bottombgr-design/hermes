"""CronScheduler provider interface (Axis B — the trigger).

⚠️ EXPERIMENTAL — this interface is validated by exactly ONE consumer (the
built-in) until an external provider (Chronos, Phase 4) shakes it out. Until
then the module path, method signatures, and start() kwargs MAY change without
a deprecation cycle. Once a second provider validates the shape it becomes
stable. Any growth MUST be additive (new optional method with a default), never
a changed signature on start() or a new abstractmethod.

A CronScheduler decides *when* a due job fires. It does NOT decide what firing
means: execution + delivery stay in cron.scheduler.run_job / _deliver_result,
shared by all providers. Providers must never reimplement agent construction or
delivery.

The built-in InProcessCronScheduler runs the historical 60s daemon-thread
ticker. Alternative providers (e.g. Chronos, a NAS-mediated managed-cron
provider for scale-to-zero deployments) live under plugins/cron_providers/<name>/ and are
selected via the `cron.provider` config key (empty = built-in). The reserved
value ``none`` (aliases: ``off``, ``disabled``) selects NullCronScheduler — no
trigger at all — for instances that must never fire cron (e.g. the standby in
an active/standby HA pair, #56103).
