"""Verified-completion helpers for kanban tasks (#70806).

Policy + execution for the opt-in completion gate: a task created with
``--verify-cmd <command>`` (or ``--verify auto``) must pass verification
before ``kanban_complete`` is allowed to flip it ``done``. This module holds
the two verification strategies and their shared plumbing; it performs **no
DB access** — recording rejections is ``kanban_db.record_verify_failure``'s
job, and the gate itself lives in ``tools/kanban_tools.py``.

Philosophy, inherited from the verification evidence ledger
(``agent/verification_evidence.py``): strictly opt-in, the ledger stays
passive and is only ever *read* here, and targeted evidence is never
upgraded into a repo-green completion claim.

Infra failures (missing workspace, spawn error, timeout, ledger
``not_applicable``) fail **closed** — for a correctness gate, fail-open
contradicts "never silently done", and the bounded retry budget prevents
infinite infra-red loops (they end in ``blocked`` with the evidence saying
why).

Memory note (MVP-accepted): ``communicate()`` buffers the verify command's
full merged output before capping; a pathological command emitting gigabytes
balloons worker RSS. Incremental bounded reads are a follow-up.

Orphan note (MVP-accepted): the timeout lives in THIS process's
``communicate()`` call, and ``start_new_session=True`` detaches the verify
shell into its own session. A worker SIGKILLed mid-verify (dispatcher
runtime limit, OOM) therefore orphans a hung verify command with nobody
left to enforce its bound — it runs until it exits on its own (documented
in the kanban guide's cmd-mode traps). The state machine stays correct
either way: the run-id CAS turns the dead run's writes into audited
no-ops. Follow-up options: a dispatcher kill that signals the worker's
whole process tree, or a self-bounding wrapper around the verify shell.
