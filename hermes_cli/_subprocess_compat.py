"""Windows subprocess compatibility helpers.

Hermes is developed on Linux / macOS and tested natively on Windows too.
Several common subprocess patterns break silently-or-loudly on Windows:

* ``["npm", "install", ...]`` — on Windows ``npm`` is ``npm.cmd``, a batch
  shim.  ``subprocess.Popen(["npm", ...])`` fails with WinError 193
  ("not a valid Win32 application") because CreateProcessW can't run a
  ``.cmd`` file without ``shell=True`` or PATHEXT resolution.

* ``start_new_session=True`` — on POSIX, this maps to ``os.setsid()`` and
  actually detaches the child.  On Windows it's silently ignored; the
  Windows equivalent is the ``CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP | CREATE_NO_WINDOW``
  creationflags bundle, which Python only applies when you pass it
  explicitly.

* Console-window flashes — every ``subprocess.Popen`` of a ``.exe`` on
  Windows spawns a cmd window briefly unless ``CREATE_NO_WINDOW`` is
  passed.  Cosmetic but jarring for background daemons.

This module centralizes the platform-branching logic so the rest of the
codebase doesn't sprinkle ``if sys.platform == "win32":`` everywhere.

**All helpers are no-ops on non-Windows** — calling them in Linux/macOS
code paths is safe by design.  That's the "do no damage on POSIX"
guarantee.

    On Windows, commands like ``npm``, ``npx``, ``yarn``, ``pnpm``,
    ``playwright``, ``prettier`` ship as ``.cmd`` files (batch shims).
    ``subprocess.Popen(["npm", "install"])`` fails with WinError 193
    because CreateProcessW doesn't execute batch files directly.

    ``shutil.which(name)`` *does* resolve ``.cmd`` via PATHEXT and returns
    the fully-qualified path — which CreateProcessW accepts because the
    extension tells Windows to route through ``cmd.exe /c``.

    On POSIX ``shutil.which`` also returns a fully-qualified path when
    found.  That's a small change from bare-name resolution (the OS does
    its own PATH search) but functionally identical and has the side
    benefit of making the argv reproducible in logs.

    Behavior when the command is not on PATH:
    - On Windows: return the bare name — caller can still try with
      ``shell=True`` as a last resort, OR the subsequent Popen will
      raise FileNotFoundError with a readable error we want to surface.
    - On POSIX: same.  Bare ``npm`` on a Linux box without npm installed
      fails the same way it did before this function existed.

#
# 1. MSDN (Process Creation Flags): CREATE_NO_WINDOW "is ignored if used with
#    either CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE or DETACHED_PROCESS".  Combining them means
#    DETACHED_PROCESS governs and the no-window bit is dead.
# 2. A DETACHED_PROCESS child has NO console at all, so every console-subsystem
#    descendant it ever spawns (git, gh, cmd, node, wmic, powershell, …) must
#    allocate its OWN console — a visible flash per spawn, including spawns
#    inside third-party libraries that no per-call-site CREATE_NO_WINDOW sweep
#    can reach.  A CREATE_NO_WINDOW child instead OWNS a hidden console that
#    all descendants inherit, making "no flashing windows" a property of the
#    one daemon launch.  Root cause isolated + A/B verified on Windows 11 by
#    the desktop backend fix (commit aa2ae36c3f): with per-site hide flags
#    neutered, naive git/gh/cmd spawns don't flash under a hidden-console

def windows_detach_flags() -> int:
    """Return Win32 creationflags that detach a child from the parent
    console and process group without leaving it console-less.  0 on
    non-Windows.

    Pair with ``start_new_session=False`` (default) when calling
    subprocess.Popen — on POSIX use ``start_new_session=True`` instead,
    which maps to ``os.setsid()`` in the child.

    Rationale:
    - ``CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`` — child has its own process group so
      Ctrl+C in the parent console doesn't propagate.
    - ``CREATE_NO_WINDOW`` — the child gets its own fresh console that is
      never shown.  This both detaches it from the parent's console
      lifetime (closing the launching terminal doesn't CTRL_CLOSE it) AND
      gives every console-subsystem descendant (git, gh, cmd, node, …) a
      console to inherit, so they don't allocate visible flashing ones.
      This deliberately replaces the old ``DETACHED_PROCESS`` approach:
      MSDN specifies CREATE_NO_WINDOW is *ignored* when combined with
      DETACHED_PROCESS, and a truly console-less daemon re-creates the
      per-descendant console-flash bug (#54220/#56747) at every spawn —
      see the note on ``_DETACHED_PROCESS`` above.
    - ``CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB`` — escape any job object the parent is
      in.  Electron (Desktop app) and Tauri (bootstrap installer) wrap
      their children in job objects; without breakaway, those children
      die when the parent process exits even though they have their own
      console.  This was the missing flag that made the post-update
      gateway respawn watcher silently die alongside the Tauri updater
      after the Electron Desktop's update flow finished.

    If a process is in a job that disallows breakaway (rare —
    JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_BREAKAWAY_OK isn't set), CreateProcess returns
    ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED.  Python surfaces that as ``PermissionError``
    on the ``subprocess.Popen`` call.  Callers in this codebase already
    wrap detached spawns in ``try/except OSError`` and fall back to a
    cmd.exe wrapper, so the breakaway-denied case degrades gracefully
    rather than crashing.

# Kill-on-parent-exit Job Object (terminal shell orphan cleanup, Windows)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# On POSIX, terminal-tool shells are spawned with ``start_new_session=True``
# (os.setsid), and the existing pgid-kill machinery (see
# ``LocalEnvironment._kill_process``) reaps the whole process group when the
# session ends normally. Neither of those covers the parent (Hermes) itself
# dying ungracefully (crash, force-kill, TUI restart) — but on POSIX, orphaned
# grandchildren are at least re-parented to init and don't accumulate CPU
# unless something is still feeding them work.
#
# On Windows, ``start_new_session=True`` is a silent no-op (Python's
# subprocess module maps it to nothing on win32 — the flag only affects
# ``os.setsid`` on POSIX). That means a terminal-tool shell (bash.exe) spawned
# by the LOCAL backend, or by the docker/ssh/singularity backends' shared
# ``_popen_bash``, stays fully attached to nothing in particular: it is not
# detached (good, we want the pipes), but it is also not tied to the parent's
# lifetime in any way Windows enforces. If Hermes exits ungracefully, bash.exe
# and everything it spawned (find, grep, node, …) is simply orphaned and keeps
# running — this was observed accumulating 20+ stray processes, one consuming
# ~8 CPU-hours.
#
# The Windows primitive for "this process and everything under it dies when I
# do, even if I'm hard-killed" is a Job Object with
# ``JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE``. Unlike a job's usual close-on-last-
# handle-release semantics, this flag makes the OS *kill every process still
# assigned to the job* the moment the job's last handle closes — including on
# process termination without any cleanup code running. We keep exactly one
# handle open (a module-global on the Hermes process), so the job's lifetime
# is the Hermes process's lifetime, full stop.

# --- Owner-thread-gated CreateProcess patch -------------------------------
#
# The patch below is installed on ``subprocess._winapi.CreateProcess``
# **exactly once, permanently**, rather than swapped in/out around each
# spawn. Two earlier per-call-monkeypatch approaches were rejected after
# adversarial review (issue #69033):
#
# 1. Capturing "the current CreateProcess" and restoring it after the call
#    is only safe if capture and restore happen while holding the same lock
#    the whole time. Capturing *before* acquiring the lock lets a second
#    caller capture the first caller's already-patched function as "the
#    original" while the first caller is still active; when the first
#    caller finishes and restores what *it* captured (the true original),
#    then the second caller finishes and restores what *it* captured (the
#    first caller's patched function) — CreateProcess is now permanently
#    stuck patched, process-wide, forever.
#
# 2. Even with capture/restore correctly serialized under one lock,
#    ``subprocess._winapi.CreateProcess`` is a single process-wide function.
#    While our lock is held, *any other thread* calling ``subprocess.Popen``
#    for any unrelated reason (test fixtures, MCP subprocess spawns, any
#    library) is routed through our patch too — suspended, assigned to our
#    job, and made to inherit ``KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`` without ever asking for
#    it. That manifests as random unrelated subprocesses dying whenever
#    Hermes drops the job handle.
#
# The fix: install the patched function once (idempotent, guarded only for
# the one-time install), and never touch ``subprocess._winapi.CreateProcess``
# again afterward. The patch itself is inert for every thread by default —
# it only suspends/assigns/resumes when the *calling thread* has opted in via
# ``_spawn_owner.job`` (a ``threading.local``), which
# ``spawn_bash_with_kill_on_exit`` sets for the duration of exactly the one
# ``popen_fn()`` call it wraps, on the calling thread only. Other threads'
# ``_spawn_owner.job`` is unset, so their ``CreateProcess`` calls pass
# straight through to the true original with zero observable difference —
# this is what makes the patch safe to leave permanently installed.
